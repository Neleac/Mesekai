                       Mesekai is a real-time 3D virtual avatar and world web application. Users can select from a list of avatar and world presets
                       for their digital persona and environment. Avatar limbs, fingers, and facial expressions are controlled by the user&apos;s physical
                       body through webcam video. Pose estimation is performed using Google MediaPipe to track the user&apos;s body and face landkmarks. A 
                       forward kinematics solver uses the landmarks to calculate the joint rotations and facial blendshapes in order to animate the avatar.
                       Full body tracking is supported, take a few steps away from your computer and try it out!
